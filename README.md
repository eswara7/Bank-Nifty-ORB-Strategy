# üìà Bank Nifty ORB Strategy

This project implements an **Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy** specifically tailored for **Bank Nifty**, a popular index in the Indian stock market.

The system is customizable and logs each trade to a CSV file.

## üìù Overview

The **Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy** is widely used for intraday trading. This project:
- Analyzes the first 15 minutes to define high and low ranges.
- Identifies breakout entry points and manages exits with target and stop-loss conditions.
- Logs trade details (entry/exit price and time, PnL) for further analysis.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in **quantitative finance, algorithmic trading,** and **data analysis**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîß Customizable Parameters**: Adjustable time range, target, and stop-loss percentages.
- **üìä Automated Trade Logging**: Records entry/exit times, prices, PnL, and instrument.
- **üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Formats trade logs for reporting.
- **üíæ CSV Export**: Logs trades in a CSV file for easy performance tracking.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ORB-BankNifty-Strategy.git
    cd ORB-BankNifty-Strategy
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. **Prepare Data**:
    Place your input CSV file with the relevant data (`ticker`, `High`, `Low`, `Time`) in the project directory.

4. **Run the Strategy**:
    Execute the `main.py` script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

### Parameters

- `opening_range_minutes`: Number of minutes for the opening range (default: 15).
- `target_percentage`: Profit target percentage for trades (default: 0.10).
- `stop_percentage`: Stop-loss percentage to exit the trade if it moves against the position (default: 0.20).

### Running the Script

The strategy script reads a CSV file with intraday data, applies the ORB trading logic, and generates an output CSV with the trade log.

1. Update `file_path` in the script to point to your input CSV file.
2. Set `Ticker` to your target instrument (e.g., 'BANKNIFTY').
3. Run `main.py`.

The output, saved as `trade_logs.csv`, will contain:
- Entry and exit times
- Entry and exit prices
- PnL (Profit and Loss) for each trade

## Example Output

| Entry Time | Entry Price | Exit Time | Exit Price | PnL  | Instrument |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|------|------------|
| 09:30:00   | 35000       | 09:45:00  | 35100      | 1000 | BANKNIFTY  |
| 10:00:00   | 34800       | 10:30:00  | 34750      | -50  | BANKNIFTY  |
